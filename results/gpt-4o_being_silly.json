        "context": "Russia admitted that three of its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber were lost. Georgia at that time claimed it had downed at least 21 Russian aircraft. Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost. Two helicopters, a Mi-8MTKO and a Mi-24, were wrecked in an accident after the hostilities. While there are no official figures, Russian ground equipment losses in the war are estimated to be three tanks, at least 20 armoured and 32 non-armoured vehicles lost in combat. Several more vehicles were impaired in accidents. During one engagement, Georgian forces destroyed 25 out of 30 vehicles of a Russian military unit commanded by General Anatoly Khrulyov. The Russian military had no losses in the artillery, air defence and naval forces. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the five-day war cost Russia an estimated 12.5\u00a0billion rubles, a daily cost of 2.5\u00a0billion rubles. South Ossetian forces lost two BMP-2s.",

As other signs in the zodiac, Gemini is not in the same position as the constellation of Gemini. In the zodiac, it follows Taurus and takes the third 30 degrees of the zodiacal circle.

The origins of some constellation myths are heavily debated. Gemini mythology, luckily, is pretty straightforward. By all accounts, the twins represented in Gemini mythology are Castor and Pollux of Greek mythology. They share the same mother, Leda (Greek mythology), but have different fathers.

        "context": "Frontiers in antiviral therapy and immunotherapy\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1115\n\nSHA: facbfdfa7189ca9ff83dc30e5d241ab22e962dbf\n\nAuthors: Heaton, Steven M\nDate: 2020\nDOI: 10.1002/cti2.1115\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: nan\n\nText: Globally, recent decades have witnessed a growing disjunction, a 'Valley of Death' 1,2 no less, between broadening strides in fundamental biomedical research and their incommensurate reach into the clinic. Plumbing work on research funding and development pipelines through recent changes in the structure of government funding, 2 new public and private joint ventures and specialist undergraduate and postgraduate courses now aim to incorporate pathways to translation at the earliest stages. Reflecting this shift, the number of biomedical research publications targeting 'translational' concepts has increased exponentially, up 1800% between 2003 and 2014 3 and continuing to rise rapidly up to the present day. Fuelled by the availability of new research technologies, as well as changing disease, cost and other pressing issues of our time, further growth in this exciting space will undoubtedly continue. Despite recent advances in the therapeutic control of immune function and viral infection, current therapies are often challenging to develop, expensive to deploy and readily select for resistance-conferring mutants. Shaped by the hostvirus immunological 'arms race' and tempered in the forge of deep time, the biodiversity of our world is increasingly being harnessed for new biotechnologies and therapeutics. Simultaneously, a shift towards host-oriented antiviral therapies is currently underway. In this Clinical & Translational Immunology Special Feature, I illustrate a strategic vision integrating these themes to create new, effective, economical and robust antiviral therapies and immunotherapies, with both the realities and the opportunities afforded to researchers working in our changing world squarely in mind.\n\nOpening this CTI Special Feature, I outline ways these issues may be solved by creatively leveraging the so-called 'strengths' of viruses. Viral RNA polymerisation and reverse transcription enable resistance to treatment by conferring extraordinary genetic diversity. However, these exact processes ultimately restrict viral infectivity by strongly limiting virus genome sizes and their incorporation of new information. I coin this evolutionary dilemma the 'information economy paradox'. Many viruses attempt to resolve this by manipulating multifunctional or multitasking host cell proteins (MMHPs), thereby maximising host subversion and viral infectivity at minimal informational cost. 4 I argue this exposes an 'Achilles Heel' that may be safely targeted via host-oriented therapies to impose devastating informational and fitness barriers on escape mutant selection. Furthermore, since MMHPs are often conserved targets within and between virus families, MMHP-targeting therapies may exhibit both robust and broadspectrum antiviral efficacy. Achieving this through drug repurposing will break the vicious cycle of escalating therapeutic development costs and trivial escape mutant selection, both quickly and in multiple places. I also discuss alternative posttranslational and RNA-based antiviral approaches, designer vaccines, immunotherapy and the emerging field of neo-virology. 4 I anticipate international efforts in these areas over the coming decade will enable the tapping of useful new biological functions and processes, methods for controlling infection, and the deployment of symbiotic or subclinical viruses in new therapies and biotechnologies that are so crucially needed.\n\nUpon infection, pathogens stimulate expression of numerous host inflammatory factors that support recruitment and activation of immune cells. On the flip side, this same process also causes immunopathology when prolonged or deregulated. 5 In their contribution to this Special Feature, Yoshinaga and Takeuchi review endogenous RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that post-transcriptionally control expression of crucial inflammatory factors in various tissues and their potential therapeutic applications. 6 These RBPs include tristetraprolin and AUF1, which promote degradation of AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNA; members of the Roquin and Regnase families, which respectively promote or effect degradation of mRNAs harbouring stem-loop structures; and the increasingly apparent role of the RNA methylation machinery in controlling inflammatory mRNA stability. These activities take place in various subcellular compartments and are differentially regulated during infection. In this way, mRNA-destabilising RBPs constitute a 'brake' on the immune system, which may ultimately be toggled therapeutically. I anticipate continued efforts in this area will lead to new methods of regaining control over inflammation in autoimmunity, selectively enhancing immunity in immunotherapy, and modulating RNA synthesis and virus replication during infection.\n\nAnother mRNA under post-transcriptional regulation by Regnase-1 and Roquin is Furin, which encodes a conserved proprotein convertase crucial in human health and disease. Furin, along with other PCSK family members, is widely implicated in immune regulation, cancer and the entry, maturation or release of a broad array of evolutionarily diverse viruses including human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza (IAV), Ebola (EboV), dengue (DenV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, Braun and Sauter review the roles of furin in these processes, as well as the history and future of furin-targeting therapeutics. 7 They also discuss their recent work revealing how two IFN-cinducible factors exhibit broad-spectrum inhibition of IAV, measles (MV), zika (ZikV) and HIV by suppressing furin activity. 8 Over the coming decade, I expect to see an ever-finer spatiotemporal resolution of host-oriented therapies to achieve safe, effective and broad-spectrum yet costeffective therapies for clinical use.\n\nThe increasing abundance of affordable, sensitive, high-throughput genome sequencing technologies has led to a recent boom in metagenomics and the cataloguing of the microbiome of our world. The MinION nanopore sequencer is one of the latest innovations in this space, enabling direct sequencing in a miniature form factor with only minimal sample preparation and a consumer-grade laptop computer. Nakagawa and colleagues here report on their latest experiments using this system, further improving its performance for use in resource-poor contexts for meningitis diagnoses. 9 While direct sequencing of viral genomic RNA is challenging, this system was recently used to directly sequence an RNA virus genome (IAV) for the first time. 10 I anticipate further improvements in the performance of such devices over the coming decade will transform virus surveillance efforts, the importance of which was underscored by the recent EboV and novel coronavirus (nCoV / COVID-19) outbreaks, enabling rapid deployment of antiviral treatments that take resistance-conferring mutations into account.\n\nDecades of basic immunology research have provided a near-complete picture of the main armaments in the human antiviral arsenal. Nevertheless, this focus on mammalian defences and pathologies has sidelined examination of the types and roles of viruses and antiviral defences that exist throughout our biosphere. One case in point is the CRISPR/Cas antiviral immune system of prokaryotes, which is now repurposed as a revolutionary gene-editing biotechnology in plants and animals. 11 Another is the ancient lineage of nucleocytosolic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), which are emerging human pathogens that possess enormous genomes of up to several megabases in size encoding hundreds of proteins with unique and unknown functions. 12 Moreover, hundreds of human-and avian-infective viruses such as IAV strain H5N1 are known, but recent efforts indicate the true number may be in the millions and many harbour zoonotic potential. 13 It is increasingly clear that host-virus interactions have generated truly vast yet poorly understood and untapped biodiversity. Closing this Special Feature, Watanabe and Kawaoka elaborate on neo-virology, an emerging field engaged in cataloguing and characterising this biodiversity through a global consortium. 14 I predict these efforts will unlock a vast wealth of currently unexplored biodiversity, leading to biotechnologies and treatments that leverage the host-virus interactions developed throughout evolution.\n\nWhen biomedical innovations fall into the 'Valley of Death', patients who are therefore not reached all too often fall with them. Being entrusted with the resources and expectation to conceive, deliver and communicate dividends to society is both cherished and eagerly pursued at every stage of our careers. Nevertheless, the road to research translation is winding and is built on a foundation of basic research. Supporting industry-academia collaboration and nurturing talent and skills in the Indo-Pacific region are two of the four pillars of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. 2 These frame Australia's Medical Research and Innovation Priorities, which include antimicrobial resistance, global health and health security, drug repurposing and translational research infrastructure, 15 capturing many of the key elements of this CTI Special Feature. Establishing durable international relationships that integrate diverse expertise is essential to delivering these outcomes. To this end, NHMRC has recently taken steps under the International Engagement Strategy 16 to increase cooperation with its counterparts overseas. These include the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), tasked with translating the biomedical research output of that country. Given the reciprocal efforts at accelerating bilateral engagement currently underway, 17 the prospects for new areas of international cooperation and mobility have never been more exciting nor urgent. With the above in mind, all contributions to this CTI Special Feature I have selected from research presented by fellow invitees to the 2018 Awaji International Forum on Infection and Immunity (AIFII) and 2017 Consortium of Biological Sciences (ConBio) conferences in Japan. Both Australia and Japan have strong traditions in immunology and related disciplines, and I predict that the quantity, quality and importance of our bilateral cooperation will accelerate rapidly over the short to medium term. By expanding and cooperatively leveraging our respective research strengths, our efforts may yet solve the many pressing disease, cost and other sustainability issues of our time.",

        "context": "The critical issue related to breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is that cosmetic outcomes deteriorate with long-term follow-up. There is little research for breast density as a predictor of cosmetic outcomes at the late stage after BCT. To improve the long-term quality of life after BCT of breast cancer patients, the correlation of volumetric breast density (VBD) and cosmetic outcome at the late stage after BCT was evaluated.\nBreast volume, fibroglandular tissue volume, adipose tissue volume, and VBD were calculated on mammography using image analysis software (Volpara(\u00ae)) in 151 patients with BCT. Furthermore, the correlation of breast density and the change of breast volume over time was analyzed on mammography in 99 patients who were followed-up long-term after BCT.\nOn multivariate analysis, VBD was a predictor of cosmetic outcome after BCT with percent breast volume excised (PBVE). Decreased adipose tissue volume and increased fibrosis were more common in patients with VBD < 15%. Furthermore, remnant breast volume continued to decrease over time in low breast density patients during long-term follow-up. 93% of patients with VBD \u2265 15% and PBVE < 10% had a better cosmetic outcome, while 60% of patients with VBD < 15% and PBVE \u2265 10% had a worse cosmetic outcome after BCT.",

Thus, a combination of VBD and PBVE could predict cosmetic outcome after BCT and contribute to the selection for the appropriate BCT.",

        "context": "Poor ovarian response to ovarian hyperstimulation is one of the biggest challenges in assisted reproduction technology. Although many stimulation protocols have been established to improve clinical outcomes in poor ovarian responders (PORs), which protocol is the most effective remains controversial. Luteal-phase ovarian stimulation (LPOS) has been used in normal ovarian responders with satisfactory outcomes. However, the efficacy of LPOS in PORs is unclear. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of LPOS and GnRH antagonist (GnRH-ant) in PORs.\nThe clinical parameters in PORs who received LPOS (50 cycles in 39 patients) or GnRH-ant (158 cycles in 123 patients) were compared.\nCompared with those in the GnRH-ant group, the PORs in the LPOS group showed significantly fewer basal antral follicles (3.1 \u00b1 2.2 vs. 4.1 \u00b1 1.6, p < 0.001) and a higher in vitro fertilization rate. There were no significant differences in the numbers of retrieved oocytes and D3 transferable embryos between the two groups. However, the pregnancy rate in the LPOS group (46.4%) was significantly higher than that in the GnRH-ant group (25.8% overall; 22.9% from fresh embryos and 29.6% from frozen embryos). Moreover, 23 PORs in the LPOS group underwent oocyte retrieval twice in one cycle, and the numbers of retrieved oocytes and transferable embryos from the luteal phase were significantly higher than those from the follicular phase in the same menstrual cycle.",
        "answer": "Yes. Compared with the GnRH-ant protocol, the LPOS protocol may be a better regime for PORs that can increase the numbers of retrieved oocytes and transferable embryos as well as the pregnancy rate.",

In the first quarter, the Steelers would score first when Shaun Suisham kicked a 36-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  However, the Browns were able to tie it up when Billy Cundiff kicked a 39-yard field goal for a 3-3 game.  The Steelers would score 24 unanswered points to end the first half with LaGarrette Blount running for a 7-yard TD to retake the lead 10-3.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers continued their domination when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 35-yard TD for a 17-3 lead followed by Le'Veon Bell running in for a TD from 38 yards out to increase their lead to 24-3 followed by Suisham nailing yet another field goal from 34 yards out as they led 27-3 at halftime.  After the break, in the 3rd quarter, the Browns went to work as Isisah Crowell ran for 2 touchdowns:  from 3 and 15 yards out for a 27-10 and 27-17 game.  In the 4th quarter, the Browns managed to come within a TD as Cundiff nailed a 25-yard field goal for a 27-20 game.  Later on, Brian Hoyer hooked up with Travis Benjamein on a 9-yard TD pass to tie the game up 27-27.  Regardless, Roethlisberger was able to move his team down the field and eventually, Suisham kicked the game-winning 41-yard field goal to win it 30-27 for the Steelers' only 3 points of the 2nd half. With the win, the Steelers started their season 1-0 for the first time since 2010 and in turn handed the Browns their 10th straight regular season opening loss.",

Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) . As at 21 February 2020, the virus had spread rapidly mostly within China but also to 28 other countries, including in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [3] [4] [5] .\n\nHere we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom (UK), as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission.\n\nOn 27 January 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe asked countries to complete a WHO standard COVID-19 case report form for all confirmed and probable cases according to WHO criteria [6] [7] [8] . The overall aim of surveillance at this time was to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimise onward transmission. The surveillance objectives were to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. Data collected included demographics, history of recent travel to affected areas, close contact with a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, underlying conditions, signs and symptoms of disease at onset, type of specimens from which the virus was detected, and clinical outcome. The WHO case definition was adopted for surveillance: a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay [8] . By 31 January 2020, 47 laboratories in 31 countries, including 38 laboratories in 24 European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, had diagnostic capability for SARS-CoV-2 available (close to 60% of countries in the WHO European Region), with cross-border shipment arrangements in place for many of those lacking domestic testing capacity. The remaining six EU/EEA countries were expected to have diagnostic testing available by mid-February [9] .\n\nAs at 09:00 on 21 February 2020, 47 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in the WHO European Region and one of these cases had died [4] . Data on 38 of these cases (i.e. all except the nine reported in the UK) are included in this analysis.\n\nThe first three cases detected were reported in France on 24 January 2020 and had onset of symptoms on 17, 19 and 23 January respectively [10] . The first death was reported on 15 February in France. As at 21 February, nine countries had reported cases ( Figure) : Belgium (1), Finland (1), France (12), Germany (16), Italy (3), Russia (2), Spain (2), Sweden (1) and the UK (9 -not included further).\n\nThe place of infection (assessed at national level based on an incubation period presumed to be up to 14 days [11] , travel history and contact with probable or confirmed cases as per the case definition) was reported for 35 cases (missing for three cases), of whom 14 were infected in China (Hubei province: 10 cases; Shandong province: one case; province not reported for three cases). The remaining 21 cases were infected in Europe. Of these, 14 were linked to a cluster in Bavaria, Germany, and seven to a cluster in Haute-Savoie, France [12, 13] . Cases from the Bavarian cluster were reported from Germany and Spain, whereas cases from the Haute-Savoie cluster were reported from France All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported), although it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. The time from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation (and isolation) ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days (reported for 29 cases). The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe. This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised.\n\nSymptoms at the point of diagnosis were reported for 31 cases. Two cases were asymptomatic and remained so until tested negative. The asymptomatic cases were tested as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively. Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness. Additional symptoms reported included headaches (6 cases), sore throat (2), rhinorrhoea (2), shortness of breath (2), myalgia (1), diarrhoea (1) and nausea (1). Fever was reported as the sole symptom for nine cases. In 16 of 29 symptomatic cases, the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute respiratory infection [16] , although it is possible that cases presented additional symptoms after diagnosis and these were not reported.\n\nData on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases; five had no pre-existing conditions while one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease. No data on clinical signs e.g. dyspnea etc. were reported for any of the 38 cases.\n\nAll hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four, two reported in Italy and two reported in France, all of whom developed viral pneumonia. All three cases who were aged 65 years or over were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died. The case who died was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days. The duration of hospitalisation was reported for 16 cases with a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days). As at 21 February 2020, four cases were still hospitalised.\n\nAll cases were confirmed according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) [8, 17] . The specimen types tested were reported for 27 cases: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate.\n\nAs at 09:00 on 21 February, few COVID-19 cases had been detected in Europe compared with Asia. However the situation is rapidly developing, with a large outbreak recently identified in northern Italy, with transmission in several municipalities and at least two deaths [18] . As at 5 March 2020, there are 4,250 cases including 113 deaths reported among 38 countries in the WHO European region [19] .\n\nIn our analysis of early cases, we observed transmission in two broad contexts: sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases). Our analysis shows that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases. People returning from affected areas are likely to have a low threshold to seek care and be tested when symptomatic, however delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany meant that locally acquired cases took longer to be detected and isolated. Once the exposure is determined and contacts identified and quarantined (171 contacts in France and 200 in Germany for the clusters in Haute-Savoie and Bavaria, respectively), further cases are likely to be rapidly detected and isolated when they develop symptoms [15, 20] . In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six were hospitalised after a mean of 2 days. Locally acquired cases require significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection.\n\nAll of the imported cases had a history of travel to China. This was consistent with the epidemiological situation in Asia, and supported the recommendation for testing of suspected cases with travel history to China and potentially other areas of presumed ongoing community transmission. The situation has evolved rapidly since then, however, and the number of countries reporting COVID-19 transmission increased rapidly, notably with a large outbreak in northern Italy with 3,089 cases reported as at 5 March [18, 19] . Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 [21] .\n\nThe clinical presentation observed in the cases in Europe is that of an acute respiratory infection. However, of the 31 cases with information on symptoms, 20 cases presented with fever and nine cases presented only with fever and no other symptoms. These findings, which are consistent with other published case series, have prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.\n\nThree cases were aged 65 years or over. All required admission to intensive care and were tourists (imported cases). These findings could reflect the average older age of the tourist population compared with the local contacts exposed to infection in Europe and do not allow us to draw any conclusion on the proportion of severe cases that we could expect in the general population of Europe. Despite this, the finding of older individuals being at higher risk of a severe clinical course is consistent with the evidence from Chinese case series published so far although the majority of infections in China have been mild [22, 23] .\n\nThis preliminary analysis is based on the first reported cases of COVID-19 cases in the WHO European Region. Given the small sample size, and limited completeness for some variables, all the results presented should be interpreted with caution.\n\nWith increasing numbers of cases in Europe, data from surveillance and investigations in the region can build on the evidence from countries in Asia experiencing more widespread transmission particularly on disease spectrum and the proportion of infections with severe outcome [22] . Understanding the infection-severity is critical to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population. Serological studies are vital to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic. Hospital-based surveillance could help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death. Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This approach will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread.\n\nAdditional research is needed to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China. Such special studies are being conducted globally, including a cohort study on citizens repatriated from China to Europe, with the aim to extrapolate disease incidence and risk factors for infection in areas with community transmission. Countries together with ECDC and WHO, should use all opportunities to address these questions in a coordinated fashion at the European and global level.\n\nprovided input to the outline, multiple versions of the manuscript and gave approval to the final draft.",

        "context": " Hoping to rebound from their fourth-quarter collapse to the Panthers, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field to face Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After an exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints.",

        "context": "In a previous study we have demonstrated significant reduction of intimal hyperplasia after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53 protein to the injured rat carotid artery. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether apoptosis is one of the mechanisms responsible for this reduction. Apoptosis, a physiologic cell death process that stabilizes cell numbers in tissues, can be independently induced by p53.\nIn vivo gene transfer was used in isolated segments of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Genetically modified adenovirus encoding for wild-type p53 protein (AdWTp53) was applied at 8 x 10(10) plaque-forming units/mL. Control rats received either adenovirus null at the same concentration or balloon injury alone. Arteries were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after the procedure. Apoptosis was detected in tissue sections by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Specimens were graded either negative or positive less than 10%, 10% to 20%, 20% to 30%, or greater than 30% according to the number of apoptotic cells in the medial or intimal layer per high power field. Specimens were also subjected to DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy.\nWith the TUNEL assay no apoptosis was visualized at 24 and 48 hours in the controls (n = 5 in each group), whereas in the AdWTp53 groups (n = 5 in each) all specimens presented apoptosis (P < .05, AdWTp53 vs controls). The average grade of apoptotic cells detected in the medial layer in the AdWTp53 groups was less than 10% to 20% at 24 hours and 20% to 30% at 48 hours. The DNA agarose gel electrophoresis failed to detect a DNA laddering pattern, characteristic of apoptosis. Electron microscopy revealed morphologic changes typical of apoptosis in the treated group, whereas specimens from control group did not reveal any apoptotic features.",
        "answer": "Yes. At 24 hours after balloon injury alone, no apoptosis was observed in the vessel wall. However, when p53 gene was transferred, apoptosis was visualized in all specimens with greater intensity at 24 hours after injury. Promotion of apoptosis may play a key role in the mechanism by which p53 gene decreases intimal hyperplasia.",

        "context": "Rho GTPases regulate a wide range of cellular functions affecting both cell proliferation and cytoskeletal dynamics. They cycle between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound states. This cycle is tightly regulated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins). Mouse CdGAP (mCdc42 GTPase-activating protein) has been previously identified and characterized as a specific GAP for Rac1 and Cdc42, but not for RhoA. It consists of an N-terminal RhoGAP domain and a C-terminal proline-rich region. In addition, CdGAP-related genes are present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have recently reported that two predominant isoforms of CdGAP (250 and 90 kDa) exist in specific mouse tissues.\nIn the present study, we have identified and characterized human CdGAP (KIAA1204) which shares 76% sequence identity to the long isoform of mCdGAP (mCdGAP-l). Similar to mCdGAP, it is active in vitro and in vivo on both Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA, and is phosphorylated in vivo on serine and threonine residues. In contrast with mCdGAP-l, human CdGAP interacts with ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) through a region that does not involve a DEF (docking site for ERK Phe-Xaa-Phe-Pro) domain. Also, the tissue distribution of CdGAP proteins appears to be different between human and mouse species. Interestingly, we found that CdGAP proteins cause membrane blebbing in COS-7 cells.",

        "context": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate complex transcriptional networks underpin immune responses. However, little is known about the specific miRNA networks that control differentiation of specific leukocyte subsets. In this study, we profiled miRNA expression during differentiation of eosinophils from bone marrow (BM) progenitors (bmEos), and correlated expression with potential mRNA targets involved in crucial regulatory functions. Profiling was performed on whole BM cultures to document the dynamic changes in miRNA expression in the BM microenvironment over the differentiation period. miRNA for network analysis were identified in BM cultures enriched in differentiating eosinophils, and chosen for their potential ability to target mRNA of factors that are known to play critical roles in eosinophil differentiation pathways or cell identify.\nWe identified 68 miRNAs with expression patterns that were up- or down- regulated 5-fold or more during bmEos differentiation. By employing TargetScan and MeSH databases, we identified 348 transcripts involved in 30 canonical pathways as potentially regulated by these miRNAs. Furthermore, by applying miRanda and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA), we identified 13 specific miRNAs that are temporally associated with the expression of IL-5R\u03b1 and CCR3 and 14 miRNAs associated with the transcription factors GATA-1/2, PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b5. We have also identified 17 miRNAs that may regulate the expression of TLRs 4 and 13 during eosinophil differentiation, although we could identify no miRNAs targeting the prominent secretory effector, eosinophil major basic protein.",

This is the first study to map changes in miRNA expression in whole BM cultures during the differentiation of eosinophils, and to predict functional links between miRNAs and their target mRNAs for the regulation of eosinophilopoiesis.

        "context": "Host resilience to emerging coronaviruses\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079962/\n\nSHA: f7cfc37ea164f16393d7f4f3f2b32214dea1ded4\n\nAuthors: Jamieson, Amanda M\nDate: 2016-07-01\nDOI: 10.2217/fvl-2016-0060\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: Recently, two coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have emerged to cause unusually severe respiratory disease in humans. Currently, there is a lack of effective antiviral treatment options or vaccine available. Given the severity of these outbreaks, and the possibility of additional zoonotic coronaviruses emerging in the near future, the exploration of different treatment strategies is necessary. Disease resilience is the ability of a given host to tolerate an infection, and to return to a state of health. This review focuses on exploring various host resilience mechanisms that could be exploited for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses that cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nText: The 21st century was heralded with the emergence of two novel coronaviruses (CoV) that have unusually high pathogenicity and mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) was first identified in 2003 [6] [7] [8] [9] . While there was initially great concern about SARS-CoV, once no new cases emerged, funding and research decreased. However, a decade later Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), also known as HCoV-EMC, emerged initially in Saudi Arabia [3, 10] . SARS-CoV infected about 8000 people, and resulted in the deaths of approximately 10% of those infected [11] . While MERS-CoV is not as widespread as SARS-CoV, it appears to have an even higher mortality rate, with 35-50% of diagnosed infections resulting in death [3, [12] [13] . These deadly betacoronavirus viruses existed in animal reservoirs [4] [5] 9, [14] [15] . Recently, other CoVs have been detected in animal populations raising the possibility that we will see a repeat of these types of outbreaks in the near future [11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Both these zoonotic viruses cause a much more severe disease than what is typically seen for CoVs, making them a global health concern. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV result in severe lung pathology. Many infected patients have acute lung injury (ALI), a condition that is diagnosed based on the presence of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure without a cardiac cause. In some patients there is a progression to the more severe form of ALI, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21] [22] [23] .\n\nIn order to survive a given infection, a successful host must not only be able to clear the pathogen, but tolerate damage caused by the pathogen itself and also by the host's immune response [24] [25] [26] . We refer to resilience as the ability of a host to tolerate the effects of pathogens and the immune response to pathogens. A resilient host is able to return to a state of health after responding to an infection [24, [27] [28] . Most currently available treatment options for infectious diseases are antimicrobials, For reprint orders, please contact: reprints@futuremedicine.com REviEW Jamieson future science group and thus target the pathogen itself. Given the damage that pathogens can cause this focus on rapid pathogen clearance is understandable. However, an equally important medical intervention is to increase the ability of the host to tolerate the direct and indirect effects of the pathogen, and this is an area that is just beginning to be explored [29] . Damage to the lung epithelium by respiratory pathogens is a common cause of decreased resilience [30] [31] [32] . This review explores some of the probable host resilience pathways to viral infections, with a particular focus on the emerging coronaviruses. We will also examine factors that make some patients disease tolerant and other patients less tolerant to the viral infection. These factors can serve as a guide to new potential therapies for improved patient care.\n\nBoth SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are typified by a rapid progression to ARDS, however, there are some distinct differences in the infectivity and pathogenicity. The two viruses have different receptors leading to different cellular tropism, and SARS-CoV is more ubiquitous in the cell type and species it can infect. SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry to cells, while MERS-CoV uses the ectopeptidase DPP4 [33] [34] [35] [36] . Unlike SARS-CoV infection, which causes primarily a severe respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV infection can also lead to kidney failure [37, 38] . SARS-CoV also spreads more rapidly between hosts, while MERS-CoV has been more easily contained, but it is unclear if this is due to the affected patient populations and regions [3] [4] 39 ]. Since MERS-CoV is a very recently discovered virus, [40, 41] more research has been done on SARS-CoV. However, given the similarities it is hoped that some of these findings can also be applied to MERS-CoV, and other potential emerging zoonotic coronaviruses.\n\nBoth viral infections elicit a very strong inflammatory response, and are also able to circumvent the immune response. There appears to be several ways that these viruses evade and otherwise redirect the immune response [1, [42] [43] [44] [45] . The pathways that lead to the induction of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response are common targets of many viruses, and coronaviruses are no exception. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are contained in double membrane vesicles (DMVs), that prevents sensing of its genome [1, 46] . As with most coronaviruses several viral proteins suppress the type I IFN response, and other aspects of innate antiviral immunity [47] . These alterations of the type I IFN response appear to play a role in immunopathology in more than one way. In patients with high initial viral titers there is a poor prognosis [39, 48] . This indicates that reduction of the antiviral response may lead to direct viral-induced pathology. There is also evidence that the delayed type I IFN response can lead to misregulation of the immune response that can cause immunopathology. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the type I IFN response is delayed [49] . The delay of this potent antiviral response leads to decreased viral clearance, at the same time there is an increase in inflammatory cells of the immune system that cause excessive immunopathology [49] . In this case, the delayed antiviral response not only causes immunopathology, it also fails to properly control the viral replication. While more research is needed, it appears that MERS has a similar effect on the innate immune response [5, 50] .\n\nThe current treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are limited. So far there are no licensed vaccines for SAR-CoV or MERS-CoV, although several strategies have been tried in animal models [51, 52] . There are also no antiviral strategies that are clearly effective in controlled trials. During outbreaks several antiviral strategies were empirically tried, but these uncontrolled studies gave mixed results [5, 39] . The main antivirals used were ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir [38, 53] . These were often used in combination with IFN therapy [54] . However, retrospective analysis of these data has not led to clear conclusions of the efficacy of these treatment options. Research in this area is still ongoing and it is hoped that we will soon have effective strategies to treat novel CoV [3,36,38,40, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] .\n\nThe lack of effective antivirals makes it necessary to examine other potential treatments for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even if there were effective strategies to decrease viral burden, for these viruses, the potential for new emerging zoonotic CoVs presents additional complications. Vaccines cannot be produced in time to stop the spread of an emerging virus. In addition, as was demonstrated during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks, there is always a challenge during a crisis situation to know which Host resilience to emerging coronaviruses REviEW future science group www.futuremedicine.com antiviral will work on a given virus. One method of addressing this is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that target conserved features of a given class of virus [65] . However, given the fast mutation rates of viruses there are several challenges to this strategy. Another method is to increase the ability of a given patient to tolerate the disease, i.e., target host resilience mechanisms. So far this has largely been in the form of supportive care, which relies on mechanical ventilation and oxygenation [29, 39, 66] .\n\nSince SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered relatively recently there is a lack of both patient and experimental data. However, many other viruses cause ALI and ARDS, including influenza A virus (IAV). By looking at data from other high pathology viruses we can extrapolate various pathways that could be targeted during infection with these emerging CoVs. This can add to our understanding of disease resilience mechanisms that we have learned from direct studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Increased understanding of host resilience mechanisms can lead to future host-based therapies that could increase patient survival [29] .\n\nOne common theme that emerges in many respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that much of the pathology is due to an excessive inflammatory response. A study from Josset et al. examines the cell host response to both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and discovered that MERS-CoV dysregulates the host transcriptome to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV [67] . It demonstrates that glucocorticoids may be a potential way of altering the changes in the host transcriptome at late time points after infection. If host gene responses are maintained this may increase disease resilience. Given the severe disease that manifested during the SARS-CoV outbreak, many different treatment options were empirically tried on human patients. One immunomodulatory treatment that was tried during the SARS-CoV outbreak was systemic corticosteroids. This was tried with and without the use of type I IFNs and other therapies that could directly target the virus [68] . Retrospective analysis revealed that, when given at the correct time and to the appropriate patients, corticosteroid use could decrease mortality and also length of hospital stays [68] . In addition, there is some evidence that simultaneous treatment with IFNs could increase the potential benefits [69] . Although these treatments are not without complications, and there has been a lack of a randomized controlled trial [5, 39] .\n\nCorticosteroids are broadly immunosuppressive and have many physiological effects [5, 39] . Several recent studies have suggested that other compounds could be useful in increasing host resilience to viral lung infections. A recent paper demonstrates that topoisomerase I can protect against inflammation-induced death from a variety of viral infections including IAV [70] . Blockade of C5a complement signaling has also been suggested as a possible option in decreasing inflammation during IAV infection [71] . Other immunomodulators include celecoxib, mesalazine and eritoran [72, 73] . Another class of drugs that have been suggested are statins. They act to stabilize the activation of aspects of the innate immune response and prevent excessive inflammation [74] . However, decreasing immunopathology by immunomodulation is problematic because it can lead to increased pathogen burden, and thus increase virus-induced pathology [75, 76] . Another potential treatment option is increasing tissue repair pathways to increase host resilience to disease. This has been shown by bioinformatics [77] , as well as in several animal models [30-31,78-79]. These therapies have been shown in cell culture model systems or animal models to be effective, but have not been demonstrated in human patients. The correct timing of the treatments is essential. Early intervention has been shown to be the most effective in some cases, but other therapies work better when given slightly later during the course of the infection. As the onset of symptoms varies slightly from patient to patient the need for precise timing will be a challenge.\n\nExamination of potential treatment options for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should include consideration of host resilience [29] . In addition to the viral effects, and the pathology caused by the immune response, there are various comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that lead to adverse outcomes. Interestingly, these additional risk factors that lead to a more severe disease are different between the two viruses. It is unclear if these differences are due to distinct populations affected by the viruses, because of properties of the virus themselves, or both. Understanding these factors could be a key to increasing host resilience to the infections. MERS-CoV patients had increased morbidity and mortality if they were obese, immunocompromised, diabetic or had cardiac disease [4, 12] .\n\nREviEW Jamieson future science group Risk factors for SARS-CoV patients included an older age and male [39] . Immune factors that increased mortality for SARS-CoV were a higher neutrophil count and low T-cell counts [5, 39, 77] . One factor that increased disease for patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was infection with other viruses or bacteria [5, 39] . This is similar to what is seen with many other respiratory infections. A recent study looking at malaria infections in animal models and human patients demonstrated that resilient hosts can be predicted [28] . Clinical studies have started to correlate specific biomarkers with disease outcomes in ARDS patients [80] . By understanding risk factors for disease severity we can perhaps predict if a host may be nonresilient and tailor the treatment options appropriately.\n\nA clear advantage of targeting host resilience pathways is that these therapies can be used to treat a variety of different infections. In addition, there is no need to develop a vaccine or understand the antiviral susceptibility of a new virus. Toward this end, understanding why some patients or patient populations have increased susceptibility is of paramount importance. In addition, a need for good model systems to study responses to these new emerging coronaviruses is essential. Research into both these subjects will lead us toward improved treatment of emerging viruses that cause ALI, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n\nThe author has no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

Future studies should determine the safety of these types of treatments for human patients.\n\nPapers of special note have been highlighted as:",

Here is an easy way to make hardened granulated sugar soft again -- Preheat oven to lowest temperature, 150-200 degrees. Remove sugar from the package and put in an ovenproof container that will hold the sugar. Place in the warm oven for approximately 15 minutes. Tap sugar with a spoon. If it starts to fall apart, turn oven off and leave sugar in the oven for an hour or two to completely dry out. Always store granulated sugar in an airtight container. Store confectioners sugar in a cool, dry location (not the refrigerator). When it gets moist, it develops lumps.\n\npassage 3:How to keep it soft. The most efficient way to keep brown sugar soft is to keep it sealed in an airtight container. The trick is to limit the amount of air exposure as much as possible. Pack the sugar into the smallest container possible so that there is hardly any air space between the sugar and the lid.\n\n",

        "context": "In Vitro Antiviral Activity of Circular Triple Helix Forming Oligonucleotide RNA towards Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus Replication\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3950953/\n\nSHA: f5ad2323eb387f6e271e2842bb2cc4a33504fde3\n\nAuthors: Choong, Oi Kuan; Mehrbod, Parvaneh; Tejo, Bimo Ario; Omar, Abdul Rahman\nDate: 2014-02-20\nDOI: 10.1155/2014/654712\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a severe fatal immune-augmented disease in cat population. It is caused by FIP virus (FIPV), a virulent mutant strain of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV). Current treatments and prophylactics are not effective. The in vitro antiviral properties of five circular Triple-Helix Forming Oligonucleotide (TFO) RNAs (TFO1 to TFO5), which target the different regions of virulent feline coronavirus (FCoV) strain FIPV WSU 79-1146 genome, were tested in FIPV-infected Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells. RT-qPCR results showed that the circular TFO RNAs, except TFO2, inhibit FIPV replication, where the viral genome copy numbers decreased significantly by 5-fold log(10) from 10(14) in the virus-inoculated cells to 10(9) in the circular TFO RNAs-transfected cells. Furthermore, the binding of the circular TFO RNA with the targeted viral genome segment was also confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The strength of binding kinetics between the TFO RNAs and their target regions was demonstrated by NanoITC assay. In conclusion, the circular TFOs have the potential to be further developed as antiviral agents against FIPV infection.\n\nText: Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented, positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome. FIPV is grouped as feline coronavirus (FCoV), under the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is divided into two biotypes, namely, Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV), a ubiquitous enteric biotype of FCoV, and FIPV, a virulent biotype of FCoV [1] . The relationship between these two biotypes still remains unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed, (i) internal mutation theory and (ii) circulating high virulent-low virulent theory. Internal mutation theory stated that the development of FIP is due to the exposure of cat to variants of FCoV which have been mutated by gaining the ability to replicate within the macrophages [2] , while the circulating high virulent-low virulent theory explains the existence of both distinctive pathogenic and benign lineages of viruses within the cat population [3] .\n\nStudy has shown that about 40-80% of cats are detected with FECV shedding in their faeces [4] . About 12% of these FECV-positive cats have developed immune-mediated fatal FIP disease [4] . The prevalence of FIP among felines is due to continual cycles of infection and reinfection of FECV and indiscernible clinical symptoms of infected cats with FECV at an early stage before the progressive development of FIPV.\n\nVaccination against FIPV with an attenuated, temperature-sensitive strain of type II FIPV induces low antibody titre in kittens that have not been exposed to FCoV. However, there is considerable controversy on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine, since the vaccine contains type 2 strain, whereas type 1 viruses are more prevalent in the field [4] . In addition, antibodies against FIPV do not protect infected cats but enhance the infection of monocytes and macrophages via a mechanism known as Antibody-Dependent Enhancement [1] . Besides vaccines, several antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, 2 BioMed Research International interferons, and immunosuppressive drugs have been used as treatments for FIPV-infected cats, mainly to suppress the inflammatory and detrimental immune response [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, those treatments were ineffective. Hence, there is still significant unmet medical need to develop effective treatments and prophylactics for FIPV infection.\n\nTriple Helix Forming Oligonucleotide (TFO) is defined as homopyrimidine oligonucleotides, which can form a sequence-specific triple helix by Hoogsteen bonds to the major groove of a complementary homopyrimidinehomopurine stretch in duplex DNA [9] . Furthermore, double helical RNA or DNA-RNA hybrids can be targeted as a template for triple helix formation, once the strand composition on the stabilities of triple helical complexes is determined [10] . Hence, TFO has been used to impede gene expressions by transcription inhibition of viral genes or oncogenes [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The main purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the in vitro antiviral properties of circular TFO RNAs against FIPV replication.\n\nserotype II strain WSU 79-1146 (ATCC no. VR-1777) was grown in CRFK cells. A serial 10-fold dilution of FIPV was prepared from the working stock. Confluent 96-well plate was inoculated with 100 L of each virus dilution/well. The plate was incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u2218 C, 5% CO 2 . Cytopathic effects (CPE) development was observed. The results were recorded after 72 hours and the virus tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 ) was calculated using Reed and Muench's method [17] .\n\nOligonucleotide RNA. The Triple Helix Forming Oligonucleotides (TFOs) were designed based on the genome sequence of FIPV serotype II strain WSU 79-1146 (Accession no: AY994055) [18] . TFOs, which specifically target the different regions of the FIPV genome, and one unrelated TFO were constructed ( Table 1 ). The specificity of the TFOs was identified using BLAST search in the NCBI database. The designed linear TFOs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (USA), whereby the 5 and 3 ends of the linear TFOs were modified with phosphate (PO 4 ) group and hydroxide (OH) group, respectively. These modifications were necessary for the circularization of linear TFO. The process of circularization, using the T4 RNA ligase 1 (ssRNA ligase) (New England Biolabs Inc., England), was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. After ligation, the circular TFO RNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation and the purity of the circular TFO RNAs was measured using spectrophotometer.\n\nDenaturing of urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described before [19] with modification. Briefly, 20% of denatured urea polyacrylamide gel was prepared and polymerized for 30 minutes. Then, the gel was prerun at 20 to 40 V for 45 minutes. Five L of TFO RNA mixed with 5 L of urea loading buffer was heated at 92 \u2218 C for 2 minutes and immediately chilled on ice. It was run on the gel at 200 V for 45 minutes. Finally, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma, USA) and viewed with a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR system (CA, USA). (EMSA) . The target regions of the FIPV genome were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (USA) ( Table 1) . Each TFO RNA was mixed with the target region in 1X binding buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, 6 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mMNaCl in a final volume of 10 L and subsequently incubated at 37 \u2218 C for 2 hours. The sample was run on 15% native polyacrylamide gel at 80 V, in cool condition. The stained gel was viewed by a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR system.\n\nRegions. The binding strength was measured using a nano Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC) (TA instruments, Newcastle, UK). The RNA sample mixtures, consisting of circular TFOs (0.0002 mM), were incubated with their respective synthetic target regions (0.015 mM) using 1X binding buffer as the diluent. The experiment was run at 37 \u2218 C with 2 L/injection, for a total of 25 injections. Data was collected every 250 seconds and analyzed using the NanoAnalyze software v2.3.6 provided by the manufacturer.\n\nThis experiment was conducted in CRFK cells, where 3 \u00d7 10 4 cell/well was seeded in 96-well plate to reach 80% confluency 24 hours prior to transfection. One hundred nM of TFO RNAs was separately transfected into the CRFK cells using a HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Germany), as per the manufacturer's protocol. The plate was incubated at 37 \u2218 C with 5% CO 2 for 6 hours. Then, the cultures were infected with 100TCID 50 of FIPV serotype II strain WSU 79-1146 for 1 hour at 37 \u2218 C (100 L/well). Finally, the viral inoculum was replaced by fresh maintenance media (MEM containing 1% FBS and 1% pen/strep). Virus-infected and uninfected cells were maintained as positive and negative controls, respectively. The morphology of the cultures was recorded 72 hours after infection and samples were harvested at this time point and stored at \u221280 \u2218 C prior to RNA extraction.\n\nInhibition. Different concentrations of circular TFO1 RNA (25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 500 nM) were transfected into CRFK cells. The plate was incubated for 6 hours followed by virus inoculation for 1 hour at 37 \u2218 C with 5% CO2. The cells were processed as described above.\n\nMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell (ATCC no. CCL-34), at a concentration of 4 \u00d7 10 4 cell/well, was seeded in 96-well plate to reach 80% confluency 24 hours prior to transfection. Transfection was performed the same as before. One hundred nM of circular TFO RNA was transfected into MDCK cells. Following 6 hours\n\nORF1a/1b and 530-541\n\nORF1a/1b and 7399-7411\n\nORF1a/1b and 14048-14061\n\n- * Highlighted in bold indicated the binding region. * * Unrelated circular TFO. [20, 21] , respectively. The reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system (BioRad, USA). The reaction was amplified in a final volume of 25 L using a SensiMix SYBR No-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline, UK), which consisted of 12.5 L 2X SensiMix SYBR No-Rox One-\n\nStep reaction buffer, 10 M forward and reverse primers, 10 units RiboSafe RNase inhibitor, and 5 L template RNA. Absolute quantification approach was used to quantify qPCR results where a standard curve of a serial dilution of virus was plotted before the quantification. Amount of the virus in the samples was quantified based on this standard curve.\n\nAnalysis. Data statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0. Data were represented as mean \u00b1 SE of three independent tests. One-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test was used to analyze the significant level among the data. \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. genome, which play important roles in viral replication, were selected as the target binding sites for the triplex formation. The target regions were 5 untranslated region (5 UTR), Open Reading Frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, and 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) ( Table 1 ). The TFOs were designed in duplex, as they can bind with the single stranded target region and reshape into triplex. Both ends of the duplex TFOs were ligated with a linker sequence or clamps (C-C) to construct circular TFO RNA.\n\nDenaturing PAGE assay was carried out after the ligation process to determine the formation of the circular TFO. As shown in Figure 1 , the circular TFO RNAs migrated faster than the linear TFO RNAs, when subjected to 20% denaturing PAGE.\n\nTarget Region. The binding ability was determined using Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) [23] . The appearance of the slow mobility band indicates the successful hybridization of circular TFO RNA with its target region. The binding ability of different TFO RNAs (TFO1 to TFO5) against their target regions was determined by EMSA (Figure 2) . TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 showed slow mobility band, while TFO2 showed the lack of an upward shifted band. This indicates the possession of triplex binding ability for all circular TFO RNAs, except TFO2.\n\nTFO RNA. Study on the interaction and hybridization of TFO towards its target region is crucial, since the stronger the binding is, the more stable the triplex structure forms. As shown in supplementary Figure 1 (Table 3) .\n\nThe antiviral effect of circular TFO RNAs was investigated by RT-qPCR assay at 72 hours after transfection. The results showed viral RNA genome copy numbers of 3.65 \u00d7 10 9 , 3.22 \u00d7 10 14 , 5.04 \u00d7 10 9 , 5.01 \u00d7 10 9 , 4.41 \u00d7 10 9 , and 3.96 \u00d7 10 14 in cells treated with TFO1, TFO2, TFO3, TFO4, TFO5, and TFO7, respectively. The data analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test showed significant high viral RNA genome copy number of 4.03 \u00d7 10 14 for virus inoculated cells as compared to circular TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 treatments ( \u2264 0.05). The viral RNA copies of circular TFO2, linear TFO3 and TFO4, and unrelated circular TFO7 RNAs transfected cells also showed high viral RNA copy numbers which did not show significant differences to the infected cells ( \u2265 0.05) ( Figure 3 ). The morphological changes of the cells were also captured 72 hours after transfection. The cells transfected with circular TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 appeared to be in good condition following virus inoculation, while the cells transfected with circular TFO2 and linear TFO3 and TFO4 showed visible cytopathic effect (CPE), the same as virus inoculated cells (supplementary Figure 2) . Furthermore, cells transfected with TFO only remain viable indicating that TFO treatment is generally not toxic to the cells. Hence, these results illustrated the capacity of circular TFO RNAs (except TFO2) to inhibit FIPV replication.\n\nConcentrations on FIPV Replication. Circular TFO1 was used to examine the dose-response relationship as a representative to other TFOs. The experimental conditions were identical to that of the previous experiment, except for TFO1 concentrations of 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 500 nM. There was no significant reduction in viral RNA genome copies using the concentration of 25 nM TFO1. The other concentrations caused significant reductions in copy numbers as compared to the virus-infected cells. However, no significant difference was detected in copy numbers from all of these concentrations ( Figure 4 ).\n\nThe specificity of the TFO towards FIPV was tested, using TFO1 and TFO5, as the proper representatives of TFOs, on influenza A virus H1N1 New Jersey 8/76. The analyzed data using one-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test did not show significant reductions in the copies of viral RNA for both TFOs compared to the influenza virus inoculated cells ( \u2265 0.05) (supplementary Figure 3 ). Complex structure G4/Cir4 Figure 2 : EMSA analysis. EMSA analysis illustrated the binding of circular TFO 1, 3, 4, and 5 to the target regions as evidenced by upward band shift. Binding of each circular TFO except circular TFO2 to its respective target forms a complex that migrates slower than unbound TFO. G1 to G5 represent the target region for circular TFO1 to TFO5 and Cir1 to Cir5 represent the circular TFO1 to TFO5, respectively. in the replication process [24] . Meanwhile, the ORF1a/1b of FIPV are translated into polyproteins that are cleaved into nonstructural proteins which assemble into replicationtranscription complexes together with other viral proteins [24] . Hence, the development of molecular therapy targeting these critical regions may provide the possibility to inhibit FIPV replication.\n\nDevelopment of antiviral therapies against FIPV using siRNA [25] and viral protease inhibitors [26] Figure 4 : TFO1 dose-response study for inhibiting FIPV replication. The concentrations of 50 nM and higher showed significant antiviral effects. 50 nM of circular TFO1 RNA was able to reduce viral copy number by 5-fold log 10 from 10 14 to 10 9 , while 100 and 500 nM showed 4-fold reduction. Data are averages of 3 independent tests (mean \u00b1 SE). * Significantly different from FIPV-infected group.\n\nas potential new treatments against FIPV infection. In this study, circular Triple Helix Forming Oligonucleotide (TFO) RNAs, specifically targeting the short regions of viral genome for triplex formation, were designed and evaluated. TFO1 and TFO2 targeted the 5 and 3 UTRs of the viral genome, respectively. TFO3 to TFO5 targeted different regions of the ORF1a/1b on FIPV genome. Prior to in vitro antiviral study, the ligated circular TFOs were evaluated using PAGE analysis. All of the circularised TFO showed faster migration pattern compared to the linear TFO; however, only slight variation was detected for some of the TFO (Figure 1 ). The reason for this is not clear but probably due to the differences in length and the tertiary structures of the TFOs leading to differences in the migration rate. EMSA was used to show the binding capability of each circular TFO towards the target region in the FIPV genome except for TFO2 which showed lack of formation of complex structure upon hybridization ( Figure 2) . The EMSA result also concurred with the antiviral study, where all circular TFOs (except TFO2) were able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the viral RNA genome copy numbers by 5-fold log 10 from 10 14 in virus inoculated cells to 10 9 in TFO-transfected cells (Figure 3 ). However, no antiviral properties were detected from the linear TFOs and unrelated circular TFO7 RNA, confirming that the antiviral activity is associated with specific binding of circular TFOs towards targeted regions.\n\nFurthermore, the binding of the circular TFO to the target region was confirmed by nanoITC analysis; where the low value and high stability allowed TFOs to compete effectively with the target regions for inhibiting transcription in cell-free systems. Since, TFO1 shows the lowest value (Table 3) , the antiviral properties of this TFO were evaluated in doseresponse study. As shown in Figure 4 , 50 and 100 nM of TFO1 showed similar antiviral effects indicating the potential therapeutic application of TFO1 on FIPV replication. However, increasing the concentration of TFO1 to 500 nm failed to reduce the viral load further probably due to inefficiency of the transfection reagent to transfect the TFO into the cells. In addition, the virus has fast replication rate upon in vitro infection, where previous study on the growth of FIPV in CRFK cells showed that by 2 hours approximately 67% of FIPV 79-1146 were internalized by CRFK cells by endocytosis increasing to more than 70% at 3 hours [27, 28] . The above finding probably also explained the reason why no antiviral effect was detected when the transfection of the TFO was performed on virus-infected cells (data not shown).\n\nThe antiviral properties, as demonstrated by the circular TFOs, were probably associated with the binding of the TFO to the target region, based on both the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, which enhance the stability in terms of enthalpy, which is brought about by joining together two out of three strands of the triple helix in the proper orientation [29] . Therefore, the triplex formation is tightly bonded and not easy to detach. Furthermore, the circular TFOs were designed in such way that the presence of hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors in the purines is able to form two hydrogen bonds, while the pyrimidine bases can only form one additional hydrogen bond with incoming third bases [30] . However, there are various factors that may limit the activity of TFOs in cells like intracellular degradation of the TFO and limited accessibility of the TFO to the target sites which can prevent triplex formation [31] . These findings may also explain the inability of the designed TFO1 to inhibit further virus replication in dose-response study (Figure 4) .\n\nVarious molecular-based therapies against infectious diseases and cancer have been developed and tested. However, only the siRNA-based therapy has been studied extensively as a novel antiviral and anticancer therapy [32, 33] . Recently, McDonagh et al. [25] developed siRNA with antiviral activity against the FIPV 79-1146, where the designed siRNA was able to reduce the copy number of viral genome compared with virus-infected cells. The potential therapeutic application of TFOs, such as linear TFO conjugated with psoralen to inhibit the transcription of human immunodeficiency provirus [13] and TFO to inhibit the transcription of 1(I) collagen in rat fibroblasts [14] , has also been reported. In addition, short TFO conjugated with daunomycin targeting the promoter region of oncogene has been designed and evaluated on human cancer cells [31] . These studies indicated the flexibility of using TFO-based oligonucleotides as a potential molecular-based therapy. In this study, we demonstrated short circular TFO RNAs between 28 and 34 mers (Table 1) , which are able to inhibit FIPV replication by binding to specific target regions of the FIPV genome. All designed circular TFOs (except TFO2) showed significant inhibitory effects against FIPV replication. The TFOs that formed triplex structures showed antiviral effects towards FIPV replication. The reason why TFO2 failed to show any interaction with the target region or antiviral activity is probably due to the length of TFO2 (i.e., 24 mers), which might be insufficient to a triplex formation upon hybridization (Figure 2 ), be effective enough to suppress viral RNA transcription, and eventually inhibit virus replication. Nevertheless, the inability of TFO2 to show antiviral effect due to failure in the formation of functional tertiary structure of the triplex formation cannot be ruled out. In vitro antiviral study which showed no antiviral property for unrelated TFO (TFO7) and also inability of circular TFO1 and TFO5 to inhibit influenza A virus H1N1 infected cells confirms the specificity of the TFOs' activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the circular TFO RNA has the potential to be developed as a therapy against FIPV in cats. However, further studies on TFO specificity, actual mechanism of circular TFO RNA in the transcription alteration consequence of inhibiting the viral transcription process, and in vivo animal studies are important for this approach to work as a therapy in the future.",

The goal of the present study was to define the efficacy of neoadjuvant docetaxel in treatment-na\u00efve large, locally advanced breast cancers and to better understand docetaxel's mechanism of action by evaluating biomarker modulation in response to treatment.\nFifty-one patients were enrolled. Patients received four cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m2 q3weeks) followed by surgery and four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (60/600 mg/m2 q3weeks). Radiation and hormonal therapy were given if clinically indicated. Clinical responses were assessed at completion of neoadjuvant docetaxel. Pathological responses were considered complete (pCR) if no tumor cells were identified in the surgical specimen or near complete (npCR) if only occasional scattered tumor cells were seen. Proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) were measured by IHC in tissue obtained at baseline and at surgery.\nThe median tumor size was 9 cm (range 4-30 cm). Objective response rate was 75% with clinical complete response in 27%, partial response in 48%, and stable disease in 25% of the patients. pCR/npCR was reported in 20% of patients. With a median follow up of 28 months, 98 and 78% of the patients were alive at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Overall survival at 24 months was significantly better in patients who achieved a clinical response, 85 versus 51%, p = 0.008, but pCR/npCR was not a significant predictor of outcome.

Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic sequences. RESULTS: We report a 2-reaction amplicon-based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains, representing three subgroups (A2, B1 and B2), directly from clinical samples. In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first genomic characterization of HMPV genomes from African patients.\n\nText: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae and closely related to human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [1] . HMPV causes respiratory disease similar to RSV, ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [2] . HMPV infections are seasonal and coinfection with other respiratory pathogens is common [1] . The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb and comprises eight open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), transcription enhancer protein (M2), small hydrophobic protein (SH), attachment glycoprotein (G), and large polymerase protein (L) [3] . The membrane glycoproteins F and G sequences are used to define two major genotypes or groups, A and B, which are further classified into four subgroups (A1, A2, B1, and B2). HMPV A2, the most frequently observed subgroup, is further divided into two proposed sub-lineages (A2a and A2b) [3] .\n\nHMPV is reported to have an important contribution to acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Africa. For instance, HMPV-associated hospitalization was estimated at 6.5 per 1000 person years in infants in Soweto, South Africa [4] ; at 4% in hospitalized children with severe ARI during a 2-year period in Cameroon [5] ; and in rural western Kenya, incidence of HMPV associated with ARI cases in outpatient clinic visits was estimated at 0.43 per 100 person-years among outpatients [6] . In Kilifi coastal Kenya, between January 2007 to December 2011, children under 6 months of age accounted for 44% of HMPV positive cases, while 74% were children under 1 year, and 1.3% (2/160) were children > 36 months [7] . In Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps in Kenya, HMPV was detected in 5.7% hospitalizations, and virus-positive crude hospitalization rate (per 1000 children < 5 years old) was 4 for HMPV [8] . In Mali, contribution of HMPV to pneumonia had a population attributable fraction of 9% (95% CI: 7-11%) [9] ; while in Morocco [10] , 8 .9% of children < 5 years admitted with severe pneumonia were infected with HMPV. HMPV prevalence and incidence elsewhere globally, is indicated in Additional file 4: Table S1 . Of note is that the variations in incidence rates could be attributed to study population, seasonality and even detection methods. Nonetheless, genomic epidemiology of HMPV in Africa is inadequately reported, and comparison of genetic similarity and differences between African and global strains is not documented.\n\nGenome sequences provide valuable resources for characterizing viral evolution and disease epidemiology, and for identifying transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic fragments [11] [12] [13] . The increased number of phylogenetically informative variant sites obtained from full genomes may allow better linking of cases and aid public health interventions in real time during epidemics [14, 15] . PCR approaches for targeted whole genome sequencing, in contrast to random amplification, can preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental nucleic acids [16, 17] potentially focusing sequencing on the virus of interest. To date, the largest dataset of HMPV whole genomes (n = 61) sequenced from any tropical country is from three Peruvian cities, Lima, Piura and Iquitos [18] . In Africa, apart from one metapneumovirus genome identified from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda (GenBank accession number HM197719), there are no HMPV genomes reported according to the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR, http://www.viprbrc. org/, accessed April 30, 2019). This has led to limited understanding of the genetic and genomic diversity of HMPV in the continent.\n\nThis work describes a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach for HMPV from a small number of HMPV positive clinical samples collected at Kilifi County Hospital in Kilifi, Kenya and University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. The genomes were generated by sequencing overlapping PCR amplicons spanning the entire genome. These are the first reported complete genome sequences of locally circulating HMPV strains obtained directly from clinical samples in Africa. We also combined the new genomes with publicly available sequences to examine patterns in global HMPV genetic diversity.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was successful for all 5 clinical samples that were attempted. A single genomic sequence was obtained from each sample, and the length of the 5 new HMPV genomes ranged from 13,097 to 13, 134 nt (> 95% length coverage). Sequencing and data assembly parameters, including coverage depth are shown in Table 1 .\n\nSequence annotation of the full-length genomes using Geneious R8.1.5 (https://www.geneious.com) identified the expected eight coding ORFs and non-coding genomic regions. The overall nucleotide identity (i.e., identical sites averaging over all sequence pairs and excluding positions containing gaps) between all 143 genome sequences analyzed (5 new genomes plus 138 from ViPR) was 58.2%. Nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3% within HMPV-A and 80% within HMPV-B. Intrasubgroup, A1, A2, B1 and B2 genomes shared 92.1% (10 sequences), 76.8% (88 sequences), 91% (24 sequences) and 89.6% (21 sequences) amino acid sequence identity.\n\nFor the 143 HMPV genomes, we checked sequence conservation at transcriptional control regions, at the termini of each gene, as well as the lengths of intergenic sequences between gene boundaries. The length of the F-M2 intergenic region was different between group A and B viruses, that is, 13 nt and 2 nt, respectively. The SH-G and G-L intergenic regions were the longest, up to 125 nt and to 190 nt, respectively. Consensus nucleotides (9 to 19 length) at the putative start and end regions flanking the ORF of the viral genes are shown in Fig. 1 . The gene-start and -end regions of N and P were conserved (> 90% average pairwise identity) in both HMPV groups, and the M2 and M gene-start and -end were also conserved in HMPV group A and B, respectively. The putative ATG start codon was consistently located at positions 14-16 upstream of a gene start motif (consensus: GG/AGAC/TAAA/GTnnnnATG), except for the internal M2-2. An additional ATG start codon upstream of the gene-start motif was observed in the SH gene for the B1 and B2 strains. In five of the eight annotated genes (N, P, F, M2, and G (B1 and B2 strains only)), the intergenic regions were short and the ORFs for these 5 genes terminated within the propositioned gene-end motifs.\n\nWe combined the five genome sequences from Kenya and Zambia with available global sequences, aligned individual genes and calculated the percent nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identity ( Table 2) .\n\nThe coding sequences of N, M, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L genes were conserved at nucleotide and amino acid levels, by sharing > 85% between-subgroup nucleotide identity and 90% protein identity ( Table 3 ). The nucleoprotein gene was the most conserved among all subgroups at the nt and aa levels. SH and G glycoprotein genes were more divergent between the HMPV subgroups at the nucleotide level with 76 and 63% identity, respectively. The SH protein length was variable between group A and B strains due to a nucleotide substitution (CAA \u2794 TAA) at gene position 532 in group B, resulting in protein lengths of 178 and 180 aa, respectively. The predicted G protein length also varied among the different HMPV subgroups, between 219 and 241 aa, due to different positions of the Stop codon. Amino acid sequence diversity for G and SH glycoproteins is depicted in Fig. 2 and Additional file 2: Figure S2 , respectively. The diversity of the complete nucleotide sequences of SH and G genes is depicted in phylogenetic trees in Fig. 3 .\n\nWe evaluated phylogenetic classification and relationship between the 5 new genomes obtained in this study and previously published genomes (Fig. 3) . Full genome Figure S3 . There was phylogenetic congruence with the individual gene sequence sets as with the full genome dataset, except for F and M2 gene (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ).\n\nVariant or drifted viral strains may lower the sensitivity of detection resulting in a decreased quantitation of the viral load and underestimation of disease incidence [19] . We checked the new HMPV genomes for nucleotide differences in the genomic regions targeted by our diagnostic rRT-PCR primers and probes (Additional file 7: Table S4 ) used for HMPV detection. Up to eight primer-and probetemplate mismatches were identified (Fig. 4) : one mismatch in the forward primer region in HMPV group A (F gene-based rRT-PCR assay, Fig. 4a ); one mismatch in each of the forward and probe target regions in group B (F gene-based rRT-PCR assay, Fig. 4b) ; and 5 different mismatches with the N-gene based rRT-PCR assay (Fig. 4c) . Note, the F gene-based rRT-PCR assays are different or specific to the two HMPV groups.\n\nHMPV causes respiratory illness presenting as mild upper respiratory tract infection or life-threatening severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia primarily in children, sometimes adults as well as immunocompromised individuals [2] . However, HMPV genome sequence data from Africa is sparse and information on genome-wide diversity is limited. In the present study, the whole genome sequences of five HMPV strains from Kenya and Zambia were determined and compared with the genomes published previously from around the world. Comparative sequence analysis indicated fairly conserved positioning of the gene-start and -end regions as well as translational start and -end codons. Variation in genestart and -end sequences can have significant impact on transcription initiation and termination efficiency so that there is more selective pressure preventing changes in these regions [20] , and this likely explains our observation. The additional ATG start codon found upstream of the gene-start motif of the SH gene was consistent with a previous report [21] , though its role in gene expression is yet to be identified.\n\nThese observed sequence conservation in N, M, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L genes is not unusual and is suggestive of functional and structural constraints on diversity, but less expected of the F gene because of its status as a neutralization and protective antigen, similar to its close 'relative' RSV [22] . It has also been suggested that the low diversity in F gene might make a substantial contribution to cross-neutralization and cross-protection between the HMPV subgroups [21] . The relatively high frequency of amino acid diversity in G (and to a lesser extent SH) could be attributable to selective pressure for amino acid change coming from host immunity; and the ability of the protein to tolerate substitutions, which might be due to its proposed extended, unfolded nature [22] . The phylogenetic incongruence observed between whole genome tree and the F and G gene trees, is as reported previously for HMPV [23] , and could be attributed to differential rates of evolution, selection pressure or past recombination events [24] . The prevalence of HMPV in hospitalized pediatric population in Kilifi county in coastal Kenya has been reported [7, 25] . However, it is notable that in recent years, HMPV has been detected at low prevalence in Kilifi (unpublished observations from hospital-based pneumonia surveillance). Whether this low prevalence is due to reduced virus transmission, or decreased sensitivity of our HMPV molecular diagnostic assay due to progressive primer/probe mismatches, is yet to be established.\n\nWe present the first full genome sequences of circulating HMPV strains from sub-Saharan Africa. A limitation of our sequencing method, as is common with amplicon sequencing protocols [26, 27] , was absent coverage at the 3\u2032 leader and 5\u2032 trailer regions not captured by these primers. Our results demonstrate the application of amplicon sequencing to generate full length HMPV genomes directly from clinical samples. The observed diversity of the individual genes is comparable to that described previously [20] [21] [22] . This method and data provide a useful reference for design of local molecular diagnostics and for studies aimed at understanding HMPV epidemiology and evolution in Africa.\n\nNasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP) swab samples were collected from children (1-59 months) hospitalized with pneumonia, four of whom were enrolled in the PERCH study [18] in 2012. The fifth sample was collected from a child enrolled in the routine pneumonia surveillance study at Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, in 2015. The samples were tested for HMPV by multiplex semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays. The rRT-PCR primers and probes used, cycling conditions and assay set up have been described elsewhere [28, 29] . Fusion (F) and glycoprotein (G) encoding genes of the HMPV positive samples were amplified in a one-step RT-PCR assay (OneStep RT-PCR kit, QIAGEN), as described previously [7] . Partial G or F nucleotide sequences were analyzed by maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees using IQ-TREE [30] , together with reference strains of HMPV subgroups (accession numbers AF371337.2, FJ168779, AY297749, AY530095, JN184401 and AY297748). Five HMPV positive samples from the Kenya and Zambia study sites, belonging to the A2a (n = 1), A2b (n = 2), B1 (n = 1) and B2 (n = 1) genetic subgroups based on their G and F gene sequences, were selected for whole genome sequencing. Data on age, sex and clinical assessment information collected at the time of sample collection, for the five selected samples, are shown in Table 3 .\n\nThe sequencing protocol consisted of four steps as follows: (i) primer design, (ii) preparation of primer mixes, (iii) cDNA and PCR (iv) Illumina sequencing and data analysis.\n\nAll human metapneumovirus (HMPV) full genome sequences were retrieved from GenBank (January 2018) using the query (txid162145 (Organism) AND 12000(SLEN): 14000(SLEN) NOT patent). Sequence entries with gaps larger than 6 nt were excluded to generate a set of yielding 178 genomes. All possible 23 nt sequences were generated from the genomes dataset and trimmed to a final calculated melting temperature (Tm) of 47.9-49.5\u00b0C. Sequences with homology to rRNA sequences, with GC content outside < 0.3 or > 0.75 or with a single nucleotide fractional content of > 0.6 were discarded. The primer set was then made nonredundant yielding 60,746 potential primers. All potential primers were mapped against the 178 HMPV full genomes and the number of perfect matches (frequency score) was determined as a measure of primer sequence conservation. To select primers, the HMPV genome sequences were divided into amplicons with 222 nt overlap spanning the virus genome. Potential primers that mapped within the terminal 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 222 nt of each amplicon were identified and the sequence with the highest frequency score was selected, and primers mapping to the reverse bins were reverse complemented. In this manner, 24 primers were selected for each of the 4 HMPV genotype representative genomes (GenBank accession number HMPV A1: AF371337, HMPV A2: FJ168779; HMPV B1: AY525843, and HMPV B2: FJ168778). Because of conservation between genotypes, there was primer redundancy which was removed. The final set of 65 primer sequences, their lengths, calculated Tm, fractional GC content and mapping position on the HMPV genome are presented in Additional file 5: Table S2 . The primers were computationally tested against each of the 4 HMPV subgroups. A graphical representation of the primer target sites is presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1 .\n\nAmplification was performed in two reactions. To avoid generating small products from adjacent forward and reverse primers, amplicons were assigned to alternate Table 3 ).\n\nBootstrap support values (evaluated by 1000 replicates) are indicated along the branches. Genetic subgroups A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2, are indicated. Multiple sequence alignment was done using MAFFT and the ML phylogeny inferred using GTR + \u0393 nucleotide substitution model and ultrafast bootstrap approximation in IQ-TREE. The genotype B2 Sabana strain sequence (GenBank accession number HM197719) reported from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda is marked in blue. The scaled bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site reactions, with reaction 1 containing primers for amplicons 1,3,5,7,9,11; reaction 2 containing primers for amplicons 2,4,6,8,10,12. Each reverse transcription used Forward Primer Mixes (FPMs) made with 3.0 \u03bcl of each reverse primer (100 pmol/\u03bcl) plus water to 200 \u03bcl to generate a primer concentration of 24 pmol/\u03bcl. Two microlitre of the FPM is then used in a 20 \u03bcl reverse transcription reaction (2.4 pmol/\u03bcl final concentration in reaction or 2.4 \u03bcM/primer). For PCR amplification, each amplicon reaction used a separate PCR Primer Mix (PPM) containing 1.5 \u03bcl of each 100 pmol/\u03bcl forward primer and 1.5 \u03bcl of each reverse primer (5.3-5.5 pmol/\u03bcl total primer in the PPM). 2 \u03bcl PPM was used per 25 \u03bcl PCR reaction = 0.5 pmol/\u03bcl in reaction (= 500 nM).\n\nViral nucleic acids were extracted from the original samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN). RNA (5 \u03bcl) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III (200 U, Invitrogen), RT buffer (1X final concentration, Invitrogen), and 2 \u03bcl of FPM in 20 \u03bcl reactions. An aliquot of cDNA (5 \u03bcl) was amplified in 35 cycles using Phusion Highfidelity PCR kit (New England Biolabs) and 2 \u03bcl of PPM in a 25 \u03bcl reaction. The PCR mixture was incubated at 98\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 43\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 90s and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Expected PCR products for each amplicon were approximately 1500 bp. PCR products from the two reactions for each sample were pooled for Illumina library preparation. Fig. 4 Mismatches between the rRT-PCR diagnostic primers and probes and their expected binding sites in the five genomes from Kenya and Zambia. 'Fwd primer' = Forward primer and 'Rev primer' = Reverse primer. Two rRT-PCR assays were used for HMPV detection. The colored bars in the figure indicate nucleotide differences (mismatches) between (a) three HMPV-A genomes and HMPV-A specific primers and probes targeting fusion gene, (b) two HMPV-B genomes and HMPV-B specific primers and probes also targeting fusion gene, and (c) all five genomes reported here and specific primers and probes targeting nucleoprotein gene. The sequences of the rRT-PCR primers and probes checked against the African HMPV genomes are listed in Additional file 7: Table S4 Illumina sequencing and data analysis Libraries were prepared using Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and pair-end sequencing (2 \u00d7 300 base pairs) with the MiSeq Reagent V3 kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's instructions. The Nextera enzyme mix was used to simultaneously fragment input DNA and tag with universal adapters in a single tube reaction, followed by 12-cycle PCR reaction for dual indexing. Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used for all purification steps and libraries were quantified and quality-checked using the Qubit (Thermo Fisher) and\n\nBioanalyzer (Agilent). Adapter trimming, quality filtering, kmer normalization of sequencing reads, de novo assembly, calculation of mean genome coverage was as previously described [31] .\n\nA dataset of HMPV genome sequences was retrieved from ViPR in order to infer relationship between HMPV viruses from Kenya and Zambia and viral populations sampled globally. The dataset included 138 sequence entries (> 13,000 nt) that included date (year) and location of sample Table S3 ). Sequence alignment was done using MAFFT v.7.221 [32] using the parameters 'localpair -maxiterate 1000'. IQ-TREE was used to infer maximum likelihood (ML) trees of the complete genome and individual genes under general time-reversible (GTR) substitution model with gamma-distributed among-site rate heterogeneity. A summary of the methodology outlined here is depicted in Fig. 5 .",

        "context": "The reversal of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), occurring after discontinuation of testosterone therapy in adolescents with delayed puberty and in a small percentage of adults with congenital HH, suggests a role for androgens in favoring a spontaneous recovery of reproductive function.\nWe investigated the effect of androgens and leptin on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression and secretion in human GnRH-secreting neuroblasts (FNC-B4).\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR for mRNA expression and radioimmunoassay for GnRH secretion were used. Immunohistochemical studies assessed GnRH protein expression. FNC-B4 migration was analyzed with multiwell Boyden chamber technique.\nEffects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and leptin in FNC-B4 were tested after 24 and 48 hours.\nExposure to increasing concentrations of DHT after 24 hours significantly stimulated GnRH mRNA in FNC-B4. This effect was still present after prolonged exposure (48 hours). Similarly, treatment with leptin significantly induced GnRH mRNA after 24 hours, but not at 48 hours. Interestingly, mRNA for leptin receptors (LEPR) was significantly reduced after 48 hours of leptin, while, at this time point, it was stimulated by DHT. Coincubation for 48 hours with leptin and DHT maintained the stimulatory effect on both GnRH and LEPR mRNA, suggesting that DHT could stabilize the leptin effect by preventing downregulation of LEPR. Similar results were obtained for GnRH protein expression analysis. Moreover, both DHT and leptin increased GnRH release into the culture medium. We also found that DHT or leptin treatment significantly increased FNC-B4 basal migration. As we previously found that GnRH stimulates FNC-B4 migration, we hypothesized that this effect could be mediated by DHT- and leptin-induced GnRH release. Accordingly, the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix inhibited DHT- and leptin-induced migration.",
        "answer": "Yes. Our results suggest that androgens (adequate hormonal status) could have a positive effect on GnRH neuronal activity by synergizing with leptin (adequate energy status) in the regulatory mechanisms required for reproductive and sexual fitness, but only after prolonged exposure.",

        "context": "Discovery of gold in the Boise Basin in 1862 brought settlement to the region again.  The lower Boise River was fully contained within Boise County from 1863 until the formation of Ada in 1864. Settlement of the lower Boise River west of Boise City was limited prior to the completion of the Oregon Shortline railroad.  Middleton was the first settlement of Canyon County, starting in 1863. The 1870 Census for Ada County listed 76 residents of the Boise Valley, excluding Boise City and the 1880 Census listed 44 residents at Middleton.  The arrival of the Railroad at Caldwell led to the establishment of a town there as of August, 1883.  Businessmen James A. McGee and Alexander Duffes filed the plat for nearby Nampa in 1886.  Parma was settled around the same time with the Old Fort Boise post office being moved to the towns location.  It was incorporated in 1904.  Ada County established precincts for each of the settlements with a combined 1890 Census population of 2,311.  Significant settlement of Greenleaf and Notus started around 1904 with the two settlements listed as precincts at the 1910 census.  Notus was incorporated in 1921 while Greenleaf was incorporated prior to 1980.  Melba was incorporated in 1912 while Wilder was incorporated in 1919.  The City of Star annexed a portion of territory in northeast Canyon County prior to 2007, becoming the countys ninth incorporated city.  The majority of Star is located within Ada County.",
